# PowerBI-project
Visualizing pokemon data for project using PowerBI


The PowerBI uses data from 3 csv files in the data folder, as well as images from the images folder. 

The project was part of a course, where the dataset to be visualized was free choice. The Pokemon data was chosen because it was fun, and allowed good data to try out different things in PowerBI. 

The PowerBI dashboard:
Tab 1 can be used to highlight strengths and weaknesses of individual pokemons, or filtered by type or by prefered stats. 
Tab 2 is a chart showing what types are strong against others, and what types they are weak or normal towards.
